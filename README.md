## App Guide - An application for helping people to use the different apps easily!

Do your parents depend upon you to use daily life apps? 

Do your parents ask you to handle all the online payments, online bookings, orders? 

**Yes**, most of the people of our parent's generation are not comfortable using mobile apps, and handling online transactions,
for people like them, I am building an app, a simple app to guide them step by step for basic needy operations.

**For that, I need a proper guide manual.**
